# Install and Provision OCP 4

The original source for this project was written by James Harmison (https://github.com/jharmison-redhat/openshift-setup). This is not a direct fork as portions of this came from other derivatives of his original project. This is a customized adaptation that will add signed certificates, deploy and integrate RH-SSO as part of the provision playbook. The quickstart playbook will be used to deploy various other services such as 3scale, ServiceMesh, AMQ Streams, and so on.
